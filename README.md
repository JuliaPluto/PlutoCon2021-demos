# PlutoCon2021 demos

During the conference, we will host an <b>ONLINE DEMO PAGE</b> running all your submitted notebooks, for everyone to see! Just like the website <a href="https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/">https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/</a>, we will use our fancy new technology to run sliders, button, webcam inputs, etc. directly on the website.

## How do I submit a notebook?
<b>Would you like <em>your cool notebook</em> to become an interactive web page?</b> 
          
You can either:
1. email your notebook to fons@plutojl.org
2. open a Pull Request to this repository, adding your notebook.

Be sure to write your name and an introduction inside the notebook. Use <code>@bind</code> to make your notebook interactive!

## What version of Julia and Pluto?
We will use Julia 1.6, and the latest development branch of Pluto (version 0.14 or 0.15). Note that Pluto is always backwards compatible, so if it works, it works!

Try not to use more than 2GB of memory.

## Which packages will be installed?
If you have done this before, write a [pkg cell](https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-static-render-test#julia-packages). If not, don't worry about packages too much, **we will help you set it up correctly**!
